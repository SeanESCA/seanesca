# Hi, Sean here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postgrad at Imperial College London studying towards an MSc in Statistics (Data Science and Machine Learning). I enjoy looking into small issues in [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to better understand its readers and writers, and learn Haskell. Unfortunately, I must put that on the back-burner for now as I grapple with my postgrad studies while applying for grad jobs. ðŸ˜…

I learned to use Python, R, and Fortran during my undergrad at Bath. I've also grown very familiar with writing Markdown documents and Lua filters for Pandoc and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) by working with Bath's Mathematics Resource Centre (MASH) for more than a year. These are the technical skills I am most confident in. I also know a bit about LaTeX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

If you're hiring or need help with any of the above, let's get in touch!
